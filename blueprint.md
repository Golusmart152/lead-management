# Lead Management App

## Overview

This is a simple lead management application built with React and Firebase. It allows users to create, view, edit, and delete leads. The application also includes a feature to track follow-ups for each lead.

## Features

*   **Lead Management:** Create, view, edit, and delete leads.
*   **Follow-ups:** Add, view, edit, and delete follow-ups for each lead.
*   **Routing:** The application uses `react-router-dom` for navigation between the leads list and lead detail pages.
*   **Styling:** The application uses Material-UI for styling and components.
*   **Firebase Integration:** The application uses Firebase for database and cloud functions.

## Current Plan

I have just finished fixing all the errors in the project. Now I will run `eslint . --fix` to confirm that all errors have been resolved. After that, I will deploy the application to Firebase.
